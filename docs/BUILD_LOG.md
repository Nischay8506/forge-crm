## 2026-10-08 (Day 1): Step 0 foundations

**Decisions (Nischay):** 1A repo in the `Forge Project` folder, no GitHub; 2B lean infra; 3C LLM
gateway (Groq/Gemini now, Claude later); 4A Vite + React; 5A ERPNext; 6A audit with the runtime;
7A plain screens with design tokens; 8A carry auth + UI shell now.

**Done**
- Created `forge-crm` with `backend/` (FastAPI, Python 3.12, uv), `frontend/` (Vite, React 19,
  Tailwind 4), `infra/`, `docs/`.
- Migration `0001_foundation`: tenants, users, roles, user_roles, outbox_events, llm_calls,
  tenant_llm_budgets. Forced row-level security on every tenant table; app role `forge_app`.
- Auth: login (company code + email + password), refresh, `/auth/me`; `require_permission()` on
  endpoints; `/users` as the first protected endpoint.
- Transactional outbox with Celery beat delivery (retry, backoff, dead status).
- LLM gateway with tier routing, fallback, call recording and monthly budget.
- Frontend: carried over design tokens and UI components from the old CRM; login, nav filtered by
  permission, Home and Users pages.
- Tests: 15 backend (auth, RBAC, tenant isolation, outbox, gateway), 2 frontend. All passing.
  Browser check: login → Users page works.

**Problems found and fixed**
- The old frontend `tsconfig.json` had no `jsx` setting, so `tsc` could not type-check JSX; added
  `"jsx": "react-jsx"` and `strict`.
- Tables use FORCE RLS, so even the owner (migrations / CLI) must set the tenant before inserting.

**Not done / next**
- pgvector, model prices, observability (see HANDOVER section 6).
- Waiting on D1–D4 (HANDOVER section 7), then Step 1: F12.1 Golden Record & Data Steward.
